# Holding

I wrote the code for this project using the knowledge I had, but in some parts, I used AI to improve the design and fix bugs.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.2. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
